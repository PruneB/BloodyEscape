Ludum Dare 44 Game Code - Feel free to advice us !

You are lost in a curious world, living under the surface. But down there, the Disease carry off weak and childs. You have to find your way out to the surface. Blood from a non-contaminated person is needed for sick people to recover. So take care, blood is rare so people will try to take yours to sell or use.

​Bloody Escape is a platformer/survival game that we created for the Ludum Dare 44. Bloody Escape was the first game we created. And that was a pleasure !

We were two to create this game : Prune Blanc -> Graphist Artist and Programmer Mathias Chauvineau -> Programmer

​If you have any advice for us, or any constructive criticism about anything ( except our programmer graphism :D ) about the game or the code, feel free to tell us :)
